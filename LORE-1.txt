lore: Many years prior to the events of current mindustry, 3 factions lived in harmony amongst the anuke star system, Blue had full custody over Tantros but provided hefty amounts of titanium and dirium in exchange for basic resources, Serpulo was a shared planet between Sharded and Green, Green had small outposts and factories stationed on (UNKNOWN RED PLANET), and Green had a decent coverage over Clesia. The 3 Factions had occasional trading routines with eachother for various projects and unit production for assistance in construction, mainly just to advance their own technology, they also shared said technology with eachother and vice versa. This peace continued over many eons as other wars happened in distant systems, eventually, a Crux spy drone had recently located the system that housed the trading complex between the other 3 factions, and reported to its higher-ups. A newcomer Alpha Drone to the Sharded Builder League had spotted the crux drone while on their construction project, but couldn't make out the details and brushed it off as insignificant.
