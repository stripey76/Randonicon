All sharded and Green units on serpulo were completely eradicated, not a single core nor unit survived, ones that did ended up becoming derelict over time, or falling into scrap heaps due to warfare, leaving random traces of scrap around many sectors. Crux cores were issued down to secure the planet from further invasion from any other faction, Crux commanders often switching between scheduled outpost zones and sending resources to eachother via launch pads to construct fortifications, and constructing newer units with the resources serpulo provided. The crux mothership had left the system to return back to its original repair bay, the other neighboring planets from serpulo were still undergoing war at this time, but all sharded related forces were eradicated.
