Upon the demise of the Biomass Synthesis Facility that was once housed by sharded gammas, the old wars were partially interrupted by the consistently spreading masses of spores, but the crux also took interest in the said spores, with the lack of any other factions to interfere, they took samples back to their mothership before departing to research the spores, ultimately leading to the creation of the Deviants, an unruly and mildly aggressive ally of the crux, while Deviants had their own sapience, they had no knowledge other than to kill and to weaponize the spores to their best ability, some Deviant core units even creating new weapons with the spores out of sheer accidental events.
Due to their lack of any real intelligence, they are limited to (UNKNOWN RED PLANET), the place the crux had originally deployed test cores.
