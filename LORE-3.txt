Alongside the unit assaults, the mothership launched frequently barrages of heavy-duty torpedoes on the planet to completely wipe out specific sharded fortresses and Green outposts, many of what was diminished was completely erased, certain small structures and scrap managed to survive some explosions, but were very dismembered.
While Serpulo was under assault, there were many battles in space aswell, constant bullet firing and specialized space fleets heading back and forth battling eachother, many dying Flares drifting off into the emptiness of space, losing contact with the Interstellar Transport Vessel alongside any nearby Cores to keep theirselves sustained. Most of Crux's fleet were successfully eradicated, as the Interstellar Transport Vessel was heavily weaponized with many dangerous cannons and guns, however it was no match when the Crux mothership had started directing its ballistic torpedoes towards the Interstellar Transport Vessel, many systems were absolutely destroyed, parts of the ship had started to fall off or even disintegrate, eventually the vessel lost its engines aswell as communication arrays to command, ultimately losing the ability to call for reinforcements. After enough bombardment, the vessels slowly split apart as many of the Sharded units and builder drones inside started to lose connection to any nearby core, rendering the units offline, while this happened, some parts of the vessel had crashlanded towards Serpulo, causing several impact sites, but the most notable one was once a designated mass surge alloy escort zone, now titled "Impact 0078" in rememberance of the vessel.
