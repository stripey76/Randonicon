Around a few months in Human time after this sighting, the sharded sent out one of their annual mothership carriers for transporting a large batch of materials to the system to help increase defenses and to make trade supply lines with Blue, said carrier was designated as the Interstellar Transport Vessel, particularly Shardeds 78th revamp of the mothership, with some minor improvements to warp drive velocity.
during this time as supply lines were being issued out to the neighboring planets, a crux fleet consisting of several B-class battleships and a âˆ†-Class combat mothership vessel had entered the system, and striked both serpulo and the Interstellar Transport Vessel unexpectedly. A grand war broke out accross the entire system, titled "The Old Wars", Serpulo was devastingly assaulted by massive fleets of conventional crux air units and dropships deploying ground forces, many of Shardeds bases and trade plazas on serpulo were diminished, alongside many production facilities and other various locations.
