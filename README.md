# Randonicon

## Content
• Over 60+ turrets: **Super weapons, Vessel weapons, Joke Turrets, and even higher tier (and lower tier) versions of vanilla turrets for fun.**

• Unique lore, semi-existing alongside vanilla mindustry. **The lore will not be in plain sight, find it all out yourself.**

• Over 40 units, with various classes: **laser, tank, interceptor, gunship, support tanks, twins, some v5 mechs, electric, fire, etc.**

• Community-suggested content.

• A plethora of (particularly useless) items, factories, etc.

• Extremely unbalanced, uncomfortable amount of content and terrible sprites. (I'm WORKING ON IT!!)

• A planned custom planet themed around Mindustry Classic.

• Memes, yes, memes. Why do you think Randonicon is called Random?

• what else am i supposed to write here
