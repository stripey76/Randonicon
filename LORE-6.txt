Fast forward to current time, the Sharded could not afford to do an all out assault on Serpulo, after having losing one of their most expensive transport ships, they decided to send in a specially trained core agent to the least lethal location, titled Ground Zero. Due to unfortunate events when sending the core through to the planet, all contact with command was lost and they couldnt trace any signs of life from the agent, they were presumed to have died on planetary deployment. However, they didnt die, as Ground Zero was fairly unprotected by any nearby crux bases, however the agent did not go unnoticed; The crux had witnessed the core gazing through the atmosphere, and began sending out scout units to check the landing site.
